# REPL-in-C
An exercise for myself to create a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop and/or simple console-like program.

With some help of the tutorial at http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/ .

The basic structure is working. Even that already uses things like pointers to pointers and array of pointers, so I already learnt a lot.  
A thorough explanation of it (in German) can be found [here.](ErklärungGrundgerüst/erklärung.md)
